# Historical-and-Parametric-VaR-calculation-for-Portfolio

Measuring Market Risk in Python
VAR or ES are common terms that one would usually come across in finance when it comes to the measurement of market risks.

VAR, or Value At Risk, is basically a measure of the potential losses that one could face, at a specific level of confidence - e.g. 99%. 

Here I have attempted to Calculate VaR and ES for a portfolio of stocks. I have used both historical and parametric approaches to calculate VaR and ES.
